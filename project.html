slides or a poster for presenting. If you have a team with multiple members, you should divide up the presentation amongst yourselves. If you are unable to attend the live Zoom session due to a time zone issue or work commitments, you can send us a recording of your presentation instead.

<h3>Presentation Contents</h3>

The contents of the presentation should be similar to the contents of the final project report, with more emphasis on your approach and results. A rough suggested allocation of time is the following:
 <ul>
    <li>Introduction: Introduce the motivation and your problem, and then relevant prior work and approaches for this problem (1 minute)</li>
    <li>Approach: Provide an overview of your approach and highlight the key technical aspects you worked on. If you have not fully finished implementing your approach, highlight what parts are done and which are still planned for the final report. (2 minutes)</li>
    <li>Experiments and evaluation: Explain the experimental setup and summarize the quantitative results (numbers, figures, tables, etc) and qualitative results (images, example results, etc). If the results are not as expected, explain what the challenges are and how you plan to improve the results in the final report. (2 minutes)</li>
 </ul>
<h3>Grading</h3>

We will be grading for completeness and clarity moreso than the quality of your results. The rubric will be split into the following categories:
 <ul>
    <li>20% for problem statement, motivation, and background</li>
    <li>30% for technical approach</li>
    <li>30% for sufficient and informative quantitative and qualitative results </li>
    <li>10% for visual style</li>
    <li>10% for addressing questions raised during Q&A</li>
 </ul>
Grades for each category will be assigned on a standard scale out of 5.

  <h2>Example Project Reports</h2>
  Your project reports should structure like a computer vision conference paper (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, etc.). You can find publications from Stanford's Computational Vision & Geometry Lab (CVGL) <a href="http://cvgl.stanford.edu/publications.html">here</a> and from the Stanford Vision Lab from <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/publications.html">here</a>. In addition, you may also take a look at some previous projects from other Stanford CS classes, such as <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs331b/2016/projects.html">CS331B</a>, <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2016/reports.html">CS231N</a>, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs221/project-list.html">CS221</a>, <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2013.html">CS229</a> and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/projects.html">CS224W</a>. 

  <div class='hh'>Projects from previous years</div>
  You can see project reports from previous years here:
  <ul>
      <li><a href="projects2021.html">Winter 2021</a></li>
      <li><a href="projects2016.html">Spring 2016</a></li>
      <li><a href="projects2015.html">Winter 2015</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
  You can work in teams of up to <strong>3</strong> people. We do expect that projects done with 3 people have more impressive writeup and results than projects done with 2 people. To get a sense for the scope and expectations for the projects have a look at project reports from previous years.

  <h2>Honor Code</h2>
  You may consult any papers, books, online references, or publicly available implementations for ideas and code that you may want to incorporate into your strategy or algorithm, so long as you clearly cite your sources in your code and your writeup. However, under no circumstances may you look at another groupâ€™s code or incorporate their code into your project.
  
  <br><br>
  If you are doing a similar project for another class, you must make this clear and write down the exact portion of the project that is being counted for CS231A.
